# HarmonicNet

This repository contains code used for the Spherical Harmonics-based 3D cell segmentation proposed in [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9433983), [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12369).

### Data Preparation
The data needs to be in a hdf5 format containing image data for the network input and positional + shape information as output.
The data is assumed to be in a structure similar to the following schematic.

`|-data_root
     |-experiment1
         |-images_as_tif
         |-masks_as_tif
     |-experiment2
         |-images_as_tif
         |-masks_as_tif`

To prepare your own data, proceed as explained in the following steps:
1. Convert the data using `utils.h5_converter.prepare_images` and `utils.h5_converter.prepare_harmonics` to prepare image and mask data, respectively.
2. Create a .csv filelist using `utils.csv_generator.create_csv`, while the input is assumed to be a list of tuples containing image-mask pairs -> 
`[('experiment1/images_converted/im_1.h5', 'experiment1/masks_converted/mask_1.h5'),
  ...,
  ('experiment2/images_converted/im_n.h5', 'experiment2/masks_converted/mask_n.h5')]`
  
  
### Training and Application
For training and application use the provided scripts and make sure to adjust the data paths in the `models.HarmonicNet` accordingly.
